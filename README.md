# Results from Testing
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The MAE value is 13.052981. This means that the average absolute difference between the actual and predicted values is around 13.05%, which is slightly high.
* Mean Squared Error (MSE): The MSE value is 308.50356. This means that the average of the squared differences between the predicted values and the actual values of the target variable is 308.50356.
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The RMSE is 17.564269. This means that the average magnitude of the errors between the predicted values and the actual values is approximately 17.56%.
* RÂ² Score (Coefficient of Determination): The score is 0.828977. This means that approximately 82.90% of the variance in the 'discount_percentage' can be explained by the other variables.
